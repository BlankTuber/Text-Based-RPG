# Cross-Language Text RPG Project Plan

## Project Overview

The goal is to create a text-based RPG system that can be implemented in multiple languages (Go and Rust) while sharing common game data and mechanics through a language-agnostic configuration format.

## Phase 1: Core Architecture Design (2-3 weeks)

### Data Structure Design

1. Game State Schema
   - Player attributes (health, experience, inventory, etc.)
   - World state (locations, NPCs, quest progress)
   - Save/load functionality requirements

2. Configuration Format Design
   - JSON schema for game content
   - Story/dialogue trees
   - Item definitions
   - Quest structures
   - Combat rules
   - World map layout

### Common Interface Definition

1. Core Game Engine Interface
   - State management
   - Game loop structure
   - Event handling system
   - Input/output abstraction

2. Subsystem Interfaces
   - Combat system
   - Inventory management
   - Quest tracking
   - Character progression
   - Save/load system

## Phase 2: Prototype Implementation (3-4 weeks)

### Go Implementation

1. Basic engine structure
   - JSON parsing and validation
   - Game state management
   - Basic command parser
2. Core gameplay loops
   - Movement system
   - Basic combat
   - Inventory management
3. Testing framework setup

### Rust Implementation

1. Mirror Go implementation
   - Implement same interfaces
   - Ensure data structure compatibility
   - Set up similar testing framework
2. Optimize for Rust idioms
   - Leverage ownership system
   - Implement error handling
   - Use Rust-specific patterns

## Phase 3: Content System (2-3 weeks)

### Content Creation Tools

1. JSON validation tools
2. Content testing framework
3. Basic content editor (optional)

### Sample Content

1. Tutorial area
2. Basic quest line
3. Test NPCs and dialogues
4. Starting items and equipment

## Phase 4: Integration and Enhancement (2-3 weeks)

### Cross-Language Features

1. Shared save file format
2. Common testing suite
3. Performance benchmarking
4. Shared content validation

### Advanced Features

1. Combat system expansion
2. Quest system enhancement
3. NPC interaction improvement
4. World persistence

```

## Success Criteria

1. Both implementations can run the same game content
2. Save files are interchangeable between versions
3. Core gameplay mechanics are consistent
4. Performance is comparable between implementations
5. Code is well-documented and maintainable

## Optional Enhancements

1. Web-based content editor
2. Runtime performance metrics
3. Modding support
4. Multiplayer capabilities
5. ASCII art rendering

## Development Guidelines

1. Use consistent coding standards across both languages
2. Implement comprehensive testing
3. Document all shared interfaces
4. Version control all shared content
5. Regular cross-implementation testing

## Risk Management

1. Data format compatibility issues
2. Performance discrepancies
3. Language-specific limitations
4. Testing coverage gaps
5. Content validation challenges
